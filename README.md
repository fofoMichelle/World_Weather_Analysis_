# World_Weather_Analysis_
# Project overview
This project was conducted for the creation of a new app PlanMyTrip which will be conducted to analyze and assist the clients using the app with their travel goals.
The following tasks were performed for the creation and overview of the app.
1. Retrieve Weather Data

- generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes
- retrieve the nearest city
- perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap
- retrieve the current weather description for each city
- create a dataframe containing the updated weather data

2.Create a Travel Destinations Map

- use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences
- use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels
- show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers
3. Create a Travel Itinerary Map.

- use input statements to retrieve customer destination preferences
- use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen by customer
- create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary
# Project Summary
The following screenshots shows the maps created for the travel destinations and travel itinerary (this includes the pop up markers for both the travel itinerary map and the travel destinations map)

# Conlusions
This product was conducted while calling API's to retrieve the datas and also visualize the it.
The process was not the easiest one however parsing the data from JSON files with indexing and using 'try-except' so not to exceed data limits was really helpful while working on the code.
